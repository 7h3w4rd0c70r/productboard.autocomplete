# Initial Analysis

## Inital Discusion

1. What to use as source of data?
    * The assigment description doesn't specify any particular source of data, maybe we could use the google's search API
2. How does the input needs to be styled?
    * Not specefied in the assigment, but in the interest of user experience let's create a styled user friendly and intuitive component
    * The autocomplete input should open automaticaly when writing; Options in the suggest list should be selectable with arrows, so user don't have to put hands out of keyboard
    * Maybe ant.design's AutoComplete?
    * Let's wait with more specific ideas until we've got a prototype to play with

## TODO Before Start of Development

1. Research the Google Autocomplete API
2. Research whether the ant.design's component AutoComplete meets our requirements for nice user experience
