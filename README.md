# Autocomplete Example

This project is my solution to the assigment from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/hejld/a292ba3840bed29837f31427baa22dc1).

## Data Source

This autocomplete example uses Google Autocomplete API to guess what you are trying to type in.

## Input Component

The input it self is in two variations - raw HTML input with dataoptions without any special styling and second variation is using select styled with AntD component AutoComplete for a nice user interface.
